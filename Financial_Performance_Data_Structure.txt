Notes:
- The dashboard now automatically parses this single-table structure
- Category column distinguishes between expense analysis and cashflow projections
- Cashflow data is automatically grouped by month
- All numeric values should be numbers, not text
- The dashboard will handle missing data gracefully
- Place the file in your public/ folder as "Financial Performance Data.xlsx"
